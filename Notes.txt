app and alarm confirmation not wrking, button onclick only works once? 



TO DO:
*MAKE AN ALARM with a snooze and end button
*MAKE A TIMER
*MAKE A STOP WATCH
*CREATE AN INPUT FOR MESSAGE OR LABEL FROM USER ATTACHED TO THE ALARMS 


*MAKE A LOGIN

*REMEMBER THE TIMES




TO OPTIMISE:
*MAKE A concertHourAndMinute OBJECT/METHOD---- made it a function for now
*make the code pretty, (spacing)
